            description="Most first-time meditators find it strange to sit in silence, to sit with their innermost thoughts and feelings, to sit and do nothing â€” the very things that, funnily enough, the mind tends to resist. To a beginner, meditation might initially feel a little alien, perhaps even daunting, but thatâ€™s okay. People have been meditating for around 3,000 years, and many have doubtless experienced the same reticence, trepidation, or wonder that first-time meditators often feel."
